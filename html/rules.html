      <h1>Rules</h1>
      <p class="text">
        TrustBLK makes adding filters simple and easy. Just follow these rules
        to either block ad-services, scripts or certain page elements, or, to
        whitelist websites.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        .txt files should be used for inserting filter lists into the ad-blocker
        where each line is a new filter. One filter per line also applies to
        when manually typing filters in the textbox!
        <br /><br />
        <span class="highlight"
          >Not using .txt files and using multiple filters on lines will result
          in your filters not working!</span

            These are rules that will apply when you want to block elements from
            showing on websites.

            <span class="highlight"

            <h4>Hosts</h4>
            <p class="text">
              Hosts are servers that are used for serving ads to websites.
              <br /><br />
              To add a host please place
              <code><span class="highlight">||</span></code> infront of the
              hostname like this: <br /><br />
              <code><span class="highlight">||</span>example.com</code>
              or
              <code><span class="highlight">||</span>github.com</code>
              <br /><br />This will block all requests from this location.
            </p>
          </div>
          <hr />
          <div class="section">
            <h4>Specific Host Locations</h4>
            <p class="text">
              If you want to block a specific location within a host, e.g. block
              the <code>/ads</code> location. This is also very easy!
              <br /><br />
              To add a specific host location please place
              <code><span class="highlight">#</span></code> infront of the host
              like this:<br /><br />
              <code><span class="highlight">#</span>example.com/ads</code> or
              <code
                ><span class="highlight">#</span
                >example.com/ads/server/thisad</code
              >
              <br /><br />This will block any request to this specific location
              and any locations that will come after. This will however not
              block all requests from this location. In this case other requests
              from <code>example.com</code> will be allowed.

            <h4>General Blocking</h4>
            <p class="text">
              This type of blocking is mainly for scripts and page content that
              will load when the website loads (scripts, images, etc.).
              <br /><br />To add an item to be blocked please place
              <code><span class="highlight">/</span></code> infront of the item.
              <br /><br />
              This style of blocking also requires a specific suffix to be added
              to the item! You can use any of these qualifiers:<br /><br /><br />
              <span class="section">
                Add <code><span class="highlight">.</span></code> to the end of
                the item - this will tell the blocker that this item is a file
                that should be blocked.
                <span class="highlight"
                  >Adding a file extension to the item will also be
                  accepted!</span
                >
                Here are some examples of a file that would get blocked:
                <br /><br />
                <code
                  ><span class="highlight">/</span>antiadblock<span
                    class="highlight"
                    >.</span
                  >
                </code>
                or
                <code
                  ><span class="highlight">/</span>banner_ad<span
                    class="highlight"
                    >.</span
                  >
                </code>
                or
                <code
                  ><span class="highlight">/</span>antiadblock<span
                    class="highlight"
                    >.js
                  </span></code
                >
                <br /><br />
                Adding only <code><span class="highlight">.</span></code> to the
                end of the filter will block any file! <br />
                <br /><br />
              </span>
              <span class="section">
                Add <code><span class="highlight">/</span></code> or<code
                  ><span class="highlight">*</span></code
                >
                to the end of the item - this will tell the ad-blocker that this
                is part of a path for a host. Here are some more examples of
                items that could get blocked:
                <br /><br />
                <code
                  ><span class="highlight">/</span>banner<span class="highlight"
                    >/</span
                  ></code
                >
                or
                <code
                  ><span class="highlight">/</span>banner_ad<span
                    class="highlight"
                    >*</span
                  ></code
                >
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              The style of blocking allows the ad-blocker to block any item that
              matches this form. This is not restricted to certain hosts or
              websites like the host blocking rules; as described above. This
              does not mean that this should be the go to method of blocking -
              blocking direct items from a host with the
              <code><span class="highlight">#</span></code> is a more accurate
              method of blocking.
