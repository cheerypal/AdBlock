Honours Project - Trustworthy and Fair Ad-Blocker

## About The Project

This ad-blocker was created as part of an honours project to study
and find out if there is a away to have a fair ad-blocker. This
ad-blocker allows acceptable ads in a fair way by only allowing one
acceptable ad per webpage. The process of allowing these ads based
on an algorithm that uses rules and standards set out by the [Acceptable Ads Standard][2].

This ad-blocker aims to allow businesses to still earn money while a
user is browsing their site by allowing certain ads whilst giving
the user a complete ad-block experience.

Along with allowing acceptable ads this adblocker blocks
anti-ad-block scripts and does not contain any user trackers unlike
its counterparts.

**This Ad-Blocker only works in chrome!**
